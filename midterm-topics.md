 * Mathematics from prerequisite courses.
 * What a recurrence is.
 * How to solve recurrences in simple special cases.
 * Formal definitions of O, Θ, Ω.
 * How to prove that an expression is in O(e), Θ(e), Ω(e).
 * What a divide and conquer algorithm is.
 * The parts of a divide and conquer algorithm: divide, conquer, combine.
 * How the Python function mergesort works, and its run time.
 * How the run time of a divide and conquer algorithm can be expressed as a recurrence.
 * What the Master Theorem is.
 * How to solve recurrences using the Master Theorem.
 * What a loop invariant is.
 * How to prove an algorithm correct using a loop invariant.
 * The three parts of such a proof: initialization, maintenance, termination.
 * What a backtracking algorithm is.
 * The parts of a backtracking algorithm: base case, make a decision, explore the decision, unmake the decision.
 * What continuation passing is.
 * How the Python function permute works, and its run time.
 * What a binary tree is.
 * Binary tree terminology: child, edge (link), empty tree, height (in terms of edges), internal node, external (leaf) node, left child, node (vertex), right child, root, parent, etc.
 * What a complete binary tree is.
 * What a nearly complete binary tree is.
 * How to represent a nearly complete binary tree as an array.
 * How to use ∞ and −∞ in algorithms.
 * What a max-heap is.
 * What a min-heap is.
 * What a priority queue is.
 * How to implement the `DEQUEUE`, `ENQUEUE`, `IS-EMPTY`, and `IS-FULL` operations for priority queues using max-heaps.
 * You must also understand how these algorithms work (from Cormen’s text), and their run times.
