<Topics>
- Loop invariant / correctness proof in general.
- Complexity calculation, proving asymptotic bounds, master's theorem.
- Divide & Conquer, Backtracking, Heap techniques.
- Hash techniques.

<ToDo>
- Solve problems in TB.
- Build an algorithm then analyze,
  i.e. correctness proof & asymptotic analysis.
  - Specifically, use heap to build a median finder
		that inserts a new element then return a median in O(log(n)).
	- Try some algorithms from TB / Codeforces.
